# **Fine-Tune Falcon-7B Instruct on Custom PDF Data**  
> **Created by**: Priyadarshi Utpal  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **fine-tuning the Falcon-7B Instruct model** on a custom dataset extracted from **20 PDF documents**. The goal is to train a model that **strictly answers questions based on the fine-tuned PDF data** and does not rely on external knowledge.  

To achieve this, the pipeline follows these key steps:  
- **Extract text** from PDFs using `pdfplumber`.  
- **Tokenize the extracted text** using the **LLaMA-2 tokenizer** (`NousResearch/Llama-2-7B-chat-hf`).  
- **Fine-tune the Falcon-7B Instruct model** with **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** to optimize training efficiency.  
- **Save and evaluate the fine-tuned model** by running inference on sample queries.

## **🔧 Step-by-Step Implementation**  

### **1️⃣ Extracting Text from PDFs**  
- **File Used:** `extract_text.py`  
- **Purpose:** Extracts raw text from PDF documents and saves it into a structured text file.  
- **Why?** Machine learning models require raw text as input, but PDFs are not directly usable.  

### **2️⃣ Tokenizing the Text for Model Training**  
- **File Used:** `prepare_dataset.py`  
- **Purpose:** Converts extracted text into a structured dataset using the **LLaMA-2 tokenizer** (`NousResearch/Llama-2-7B-chat-hf`).  
- **Why?** Models require tokenized input, which is converted into numerical representations before training.  

### **3️⃣ Fine-Tuning Falcon-7B Instruct with LoRA**  
- **File Used:** `fine_tune.py`  
- **Base Model:** `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct`  
- **Fine-Tuning Method:** LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)  
- **Why LoRA?**  
  - Training a **7B parameter model** from scratch is resource-intensive.  
  - **LoRA fine-tunes only specific layers (query-key-value layers)**, making it **faster and memory-efficient**.  
  - This allows fine-tuning on consumer-grade GPUs.  
- **Training Details:**  
  - LoRA applied to **query-key-value layers**.  
  - Training with **FP16 precision** for optimization.  
  - **Checkpoints saved every 50 steps** for monitoring training progress.  

### **4️⃣ Running Inference on the Fine-Tuned Model**  
- **File Used:** `sample_inference.py`  
- **Purpose:** Loads the fine-tuned model with LoRA adapters and runs inference on user queries.  
- **Why?** To verify that the model correctly generates responses based on fine-tuned data only.

## **📌 Why Falcon-7B Instruct?**  
- **Optimized for instruction-based learning** (suited for Q&A tasks).  
- **Lightweight compared to larger LLMs** like Falcon-40B, making fine-tuning feasible.  
- **Supports quantization (4-bit and 8-bit)**, enabling low-memory training.  

## **📌 Why Use LoRA for Fine-Tuning?**  
- Reduces the number of trainable parameters.  
- Enables fine-tuning on consumer GPUs.  
- Preserves the original model weights while adding task-specific knowledge.

## **🚀 Results & Conclusion**  
✅ **Successfully fine-tuned Falcon-7B Instruct using LoRA**  
✅ **Created a model that answers questions based on PDFs**  
✅ **Optimized training using quantization and FP16**  

This approach **makes fine-tuning large models accessible even on limited hardware**, making it a powerful tool for domain-specific AI applications. 🚀
